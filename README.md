Data analysis and machine learning detection of healthcare fraud for a Kaggle
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis)

The analysis and machine-learning results are reported in the R markdown file
*healthcare_fraud.Rmd*.  The rendered html output is available at

https://markcbutler.github.io/healthcare-fraud/healthcare_fraud.html

The R package renv was used to create a reproducible environment for rendering
the markdown file.  The environment can be installed by running the R command
renv::restore() with the root directory of the cloned repo as the working
directory.
