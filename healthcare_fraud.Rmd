# Summary

Exploratory data analysis of a healthcare-fraud
[dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis)
from Kaggle is presented.  The analysis has two goals:

  - Provide general insight into the healthcare market represented by the
    dataset (apparently healthcare covered by Medicare)
  - Reveal associations involving the "potential fraud" label for healthcare
    providers in the training dataset

# Dataset {.tabset}

## Description {.unnumbered}

The dataset contains training data and test data, each with four data frames.

The training data was used for the analysis.  Details of the data frames:

  - Inpatient visits to a hospital (30 columns, <nobr>~ 40,000</nobr> rows, )
  - Outpatient visits to a hospital (27 columns, <nobr>~ 520,000</nobr> rows)
  - Patients who made these hospital visits (25 columns, <nobr>~ 140,000</nobr>
    rows)
  - Providers visited (2 columns:  provider ID and PotentialFraud label, 5,410
    rows)

## Scope {.unnumbered}

The hospital visits in the dataset occurred throughout 2009 and were mainly
limited to 2009.

The hospital patients appear to be residents of the US.

  - Each patient is identified with a state and county, both labeled by
    numbers.  The state labels range from 1 to 54, which suggests that the
    data is for US patients in the 50 states, together with the District of
    Columbia and three US territories.

The number of providers in the dataset (including both training and test data)
is 6,763.  This is somewhat larger than the number of hospitals in the US in
2009 (5,795).

  - The American Hospital Association (AHA) provides statistics on hospitals
    in the US.  Although the description of the dataset on Kaggle refers to
    "hospital visits," it may be that not all healthcare providers visited met
    the AHA definition of a hospital.

The dataset includes information for <nobr>~ 690,000</nobr> visits to a
hospital (or similar healthcare provider), including <nobr>~ 50,000</nobr>
inpatient visits and <nobr>~ 640,000</nobr> outpatient visits.  By way of
comparison, the number of inpatient hospital visits in the US in 2018 was
about 36 million.

The data appears to be for Medicare patients, which include people who are 65
or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with end-stage
renal disease.

  - The clue leading to this guess is that for nearly all of the inpatient visits,
    the deductible paid by the patient was $1068, the 2009 deductible for an
    inpatient visit covered by Medicare.  (About 2% of the inpatient visits
    had NA for the deductible paid, but for all other inpatient visits the
    deductible paid was $1068.)
  - Consistent with the special treatment of end-stage renal disease by
    Medicare, the dataframe of patient info include a column of 0 and 1 values
    with column heading "Renal Disease."  This column is among other columns
    that identify a patient, such as birth date, gender and race.



## Data integrity {.unnumbered}

The dataset appears clean, and it passed several checks for consistency among
the data frames.

There is an apparent inconsistency in some outpatient visits:  the two
features that report payments for a visit (DeductibleAmtPaid,
InscClaimAmtReimbursed) are both equal to zero in some cases.

  - This is the case for about 4% of the outpatient visits in the training
    data, for instance.
  - Does zero payment indicate that payment was refused because fraud was
    suspected?  Apparently not, because the fraction of zero-payment rows
    labeled as PotentialFraud (36.1%) is quite close to the fraction for the
    full training set of outpatient visits (36.6%).
  - It may be that in practice, hospitals receive zero payment for some
    outpatient visits, e.g., because the costs associated with collecting
    payment are too great to justify pursuing payment.  This could be
    investigated by checking whether certain diagnosis or treatment codes are
    associated with zero-payment visits.

In most (or possibly all) cases, NA in the csv files can be viewed as
artifacts of the way in which the data is presented, rather than valid data
points that are missing.

Columns with NA:

  1. The csv tables for inpatient and outpatient visits include a number of
     columns in which codes relevant for the visit can be reported.  For
     example, there are 10 columns ClmDiagnosisCode_1 through
     ClmDiagnosisCode_10 for claim diagnosis codes, and there are many NA in
     these columns.

      - However, the presence of NA in these columns can be viewed as an
        artifact of the table organization, rather than as valid data that is
        not present.
      - There are <nobr>~ 10,000</nobr> outpatient visits (but no inpatient
        visits) in the dataset that have NA for all code columns.

   2. Similarly, three columns are reserved for physicians associated with the
      visit:  AttendingPhysician, OperatingPhysician, OtherPhysician.

      - Missing value in these columns can also be viewed as an artifact of
        the table organization.
      - There are 135 inpatient visits and 1688 outpatient visits with NA in
        all three of these columns.

  3. For about 2% of the inpatient visits (but not for any outpatient visits),
     DeductibleAmtPaid is NA.  As noted in the section on dataset scope, the
     deductible paid by inpatients was $1068 in all cases where it was not NA.

     - These NA may correspond to visits for which the deductible payment was
       zero.
     - However there are samples that have NA for DeductibleAmtPaid with
       InscClaimAmtReimbursed equal to zero.  For instance, there are 25 rows
       of this sort in the training data.


# Analysis

## Chronic Conditions {.tabset}

### Summary {.unnumbered}

Since the dataset appears to represent a set of visits covered by Medicare,
it is expected that the patients are mainly elderly and that many have chronic
health problems.  However, the frequency of some chronic conditions among
these patients is quite high.

How many medical doctors are there in the train outpatient dataset?

How many medical doctors are there in the train inpatient dataset? Do they
match with those from the outpatient record?

Do those inpatient patients show worse health conditions (in terms of chronic
diseases) than typical outpatient patients, or do those who have more visits
to the providers have worse health conditions? Provide an analysis on these
issues.

## Questions 2 {.tabset}

### Questions {.unnumbered}

Study the relationship between the patient ages (at the time of their
service) and the counts of medical claims.

Study the relationship between the patient age and their chronic conditions.
Within the train-samples, do these chronic conditions show a definite trend
with respect to increasing ages?

In order to make sure the insurance premiums can cover the claims, the
insurance company would need to categorize the patients according to their
resource usage. In answering the question that what types of patients would
make more outpatient visits, please provide your finding.

In answering what types of patients would make more inpatient service claims,
please provide your findings.

From the prospect of the insurance company, the reimbursed amounts are their
coverage on the claims.  Please analyze the patterns of the total reimbursed
amounts (or average reimbursed amounts/visit) vs different types of patients.

From the prospect of the providers, the sum of reimbursed amounts and
deductibles are flowing to the providers. Based on this, analyze which types
of patients contribute more to the providers in terms of the aggregate charges
or the average charge per visit.

## Questions 3 {.tabset}

### Questions {.unnumbered}

Based on the attribute **ClaimStartDt**, analyze the weekly service volume
variations.

What are the weekly patterns (weekly seasonalities) you observe for the
demands on **inpatient** or **outpatient** services?

Identify the top $5$ most frequent **ClmAdmitDiagnosisCodes** and trace their
weekly seasonalities.  Display the patterns you find.

For the inpatient patients, is there any pattern between the durations of the
treatments and the patient attributes?

For the monthly inpatient/outpatient claim counts of all the providers, please
analyze the table of provider-month matrices and report any interesting
findings.

## Questions 4 {.tabset}

### Questions {.unnumbered}

Study the distributions of **InscClaimAmtReimbursed**, **DeductibleAmtPaid**
for both inpatient and outpatient services. Your team might want to work with
hist, scatter or sns.pairplot, distplot, etc.

Study the distributions of insurance covered percentages
**InscClaimAmtReimbursed/(InscClaimAmtReimbursed+DeductibleAmtPaid)**.

Study the distributions of the durations of average insurance claims
(end-start) of the providers?  Box-plot/violin-plot based on the
**PotentialFraud** flag. Do you find any differences for none-potential fraud
vs potential-fraud providers?

How are the service durations related to the total claim amounts, i.e.
InscClaimAmtReimbursed+DeductibleAmtPaid?

Consider mean daily total charges (i.e. total charge/duration), please
describe their distribution.  How do the **Potential Fraud** flag affect the
distribution patterns?

## Questions 5 {.tabset}

### Questions {.unnumbered}

An easier type of frauds is to submit duplicated claims using stolen patient
IDs.

While multiple claims with identical information are not always fraudulent,
the prevalence of these duplicated records would signal potential fraud
activities.

Consider the various diagnosis codes, procedure codes, admit diagnosis codes
as the key features, please identify the duplicated claims in the
inpatients_train, outpatients_train data.

Are these potentially fradulent providers duplicating their own medical
records, or are they using the records from the other providers?

Assuming that the claimStartDates are authentic, identify the providers which
are the information receivers. Identify the providers which are the
information givers.

Summarize the duplicate record counts/provider and study if the statistics
have different distributions between honest and potentialfraud providers.

Do these potentially fraud providers reuse doctor IDs and/or patient IDs?  If
so, these fradulent IDs (or if the doctors or patients willingly participate)
can be used as signals to the other types of fraudulent activities.

Do these duplicated records show any anomaly in terms of geographic locations?
Even though the original data doesn't specify the providers nor the doctors'
practice locations, one may use the majority of the patients' residence
state/county information to infer their physical locations.

Base on your best knowledge of suspicious activities in duplicating the
patient claims, flag the providers accordingly. Compare with the
**PotentialFraud** flags offered by the dataset and discuss.
